# Personal Dotfiles

This repository serves as a `.git` mirror for my personal dotfiles. Please note that this repository is a work in progress and may contain configurations that are not suitable for general use.

> **Warning:**  
> If you decide to use this repository, make sure to **update the Hyprland monitor configuration**. I have disabled my primary monitor (the laptop screen), so you'll need to adjust that setting for your own setup.

## Notable Scripts

- **`avalore/.local/bin/fzf_tmux`**  
  A global tmux sessionizer that provides fuzzy search capabilities over selected directories, allowing you to create tmux sessions quickly.

- **`avalore/.local/bin/bookmarks`**  
  Coming soon...
